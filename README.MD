# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice in C++

This repository contains my practice code for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems implemented in C++.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find implementations of common data structures and algorithms, along with solutions to coding problems from various online platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces. The primary goal of this repository is to enhance my understanding of fundamental concepts in DSA and improve problem-solving skills.

## Data Structures

This section contains implementations of various data structures such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- ... and more

Each data structure is implemented in C++ and includes methods for common operations and algorithms relevant to that data structure.

## Algorithms

This section includes implementations of important algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, etc.)
- ... and more

## Coding Problems

This section consists of solutions to coding problems from popular coding platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces. Each problem is solved in C++ and includes a brief explanation of the approach used.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or additional algorithms/coding problems to add, feel free to submit a pull request. Please adhere to the existing code style and structure.
